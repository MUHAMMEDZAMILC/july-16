            <h1>Flutter</h1>
            <p>
                Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google 
                and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native 
                mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one 
                programming language and one codebase to create two different apps 
                (for iOS and Android).

            <h1>Flutter Framework</h1>
            <p>The Flutter framework consists of both a software development kit (SDK) and 
                their widget-based UI library. This library consists of various reusable 
                UI elements, such as sliders, buttons, and text inputs. </p>
                  
                <p>Developers building mobile applications with the Flutter framework will 
                    do so using a programming language called Dart. With a syntax like 
                    JavaScript, Dart is a typed object programming language that focuses 
                    on front-end development. </p>

            <h1>Use Of Flutter</h1>
            <p>Although Flutter is a newer cross-platform framework, more and more companies 
                have chosen Flutter over frameworks such as Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native.</p>  
                <p>Some of the top reasons why development teams choose Flutter include:</p> 
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>
                        > Increased productivity. Using the same codebase for iOS and Android saves both time and resources. Flutter’s native widgets also minimize time spent on testing by ensuring there is little to no compatibility issues with different OS versions.
                         
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        > Easy to learn.Flutter allows developers to build native mobile applications without needing to access OEM widgets or use a lot of code. This, in addition to Flutter’s particularly appealing user interface, makes the mobile app creation process much simpler.  
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        > Great performance.Users report that it is difficult to notice the difference between a Flutter app and a native mobile app.
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        > Cost-effective. Building iOS and Android apps with the same codebase is essentially building two apps for the price of one.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        > Available on different IDEs. Developers are free to choose between Android Studio and VS Code to edit their code on Flutter.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        > Great documentation & community. Flutter has many great resources to answer your questions, thanks to its ample documentation with easy-to-follow use cases. Flutter users also benefit from community hubs like Flutter Community and Flutter Awesome for exchanging ideas.

            <h1>Pros and Cons of the Flutter Framework</h1>
            <p>Although Flutter is not yet widely adopted, an increasing number of tech 
                companies have started realizing its potential. Some notable Flutter 
                applications include Google Ads, eBay Motors, Philips Hue, and Xianyu from Alibaba. </p> 
                <p>Let us look at some of the benefits that Flutter offers, as well as some of their drawbacks. 

            <h1>Flutter App Development Pros</h1> 
           <p>Flutter offers a wide range of benefits for business folks and developers alike. 
            Flutter offers good quality for reasonable costs, as well as great usability and speed. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>> Development goes faster when the same code is used for both iOS and Android applications. Flutter’s singular codebase speeds up time-to-market while cutting mobile app development costs significantly.</li>
                 <li> > Flutter’s “hot reload” feature allows developers to change the code on emulators, simulators, or real devices, and see results in real-time. The changed code is then reloaded immediately while the app is running. No restart required. Hot reloads make building UIs, adding features, and bug fixing simpler than ever.</li>  
            </ul>
             <h1>Flutter App Development Cons</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>> While Flutter app development presents a lot of positives, it is also important to consider the lesser aspects of the framework: </li>

                    <li> > Flutter is relatively new. While Flutter offers many plugins and UI components, frameworks like Xamarin and React Native offer a much larger selection. While Flutter will not be the new framework on the block forever, this is the situation now.</li>
                    <li>> Dart is not very popular. While it is a great programming language, developers are often much more likely to consider languages such as Java or Kotlin.  </li>
            <li>Some components are only available for iOS or Android, but not both. These types of components more often support Android since Flutter comes from Google, and Android developers are typically more interested in Flutter than iOS developers.  </li>
            </ul>
